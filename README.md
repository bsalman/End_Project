# End_Project
Smart_home_device
The goal of this project was to control the house lighting , temperature and detect
movement using a Raspberry pi 4.
Raspberry pi 4 was used as Back-End main processing unit which is running an independent
application developed with nodejs and SQL (for data base) to process input information from
sensors and Arduino based micro-controller to control house lighting, detect any movement
within the house, measure the temperature and report all those information to a frontend user
interface application running on your smart phone or laptop.
Technologies Used:
* Back end: Raspberry 4 running application developed with nodejs and SQL + low level
firmware for interaction between sensors/Arduino and Raspberry pi4.
* Front end: user application interface developed with CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap and react /
redux.
